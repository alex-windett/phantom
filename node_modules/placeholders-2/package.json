  "readme": "#Placeholders.js - An HTML5 placeholder attribute polyfill\n\nPlaceholders.js is a polyfill (or shim, or whatever you like to call it) for\nthe HTML5 placeholder attribute, as defined in the [HTML5 specification][spec].\nPlaceholder attributes are valid on `input` elements of various types and\n`textarea` elements.\n\nPlaceholders.js is licensed under the [MIT License][license]. See the\nunminified file for the full license text.\n\n## Get it!\n\nDownload the polyfill and get a whole load of information and instructions at\n[our new website][site]. If you're using Ruby on Rails, you can also try out\n[our gem][gem].\n\n##Supported Browsers\n\nPlaceholders.js aims to support the widest range of browsers possible. The idea\nis that you will be able to use the native `placeholder` attribute along with\nPlaceholders.js and your users on any platform will get the same experience.\nThis table will be updated as and when further browsers are tested. Mobile\nbrowser testing is a big one that's high on the list. Currently tested and\nworking in the following browsers on (where applicable) both Windows 7 and\nCentOS 6:\n\n - Internet Explorer 6 - 9 (with Placeholders.js)\n - Firefox 1 - 3 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native)\n - Opera 7 - 10 (with Placeholders.js), 11+ (native)\n - Safari 3.2 (with Placeholders.js), 4+ (native)\n - Chrome 4+ (native)\n - Flock 1.0+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - Konqueror 4.3 (with Placeholders.js)\n - SeaMonkey 1+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - Maxthon 1+ (with Placeholders.js)\n - SlimBrowser 5 (with Placeholders.js)\n - K-Meleon 0.7+ (with Placeholders.js)\n\nDo you use some obscure browser that doesn't have native `placeholder` attribute\nsupport? If so, please let me know so I can make sure Placeholders.js works with\nit.\n\n[spec]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#attr-input-placeholder\n[license]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License\n[site]: http://jamesallardice.github.com/Placeholders.js/\n[gem]: https://github.com/ets-berkeley-edu/placeholder-gem\n",
